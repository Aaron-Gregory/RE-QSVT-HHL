# RE-QSVT-HHL

Resource Estimation for QSVT-Based implementations of the HHL algorithm.

For a tutorial on HHL, see [the QISKit textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-applications/hhl_tutorial.html#Contents).

For a walkthrough of QSVT's application to HHL, see section 3.2.3 of [Gily√©n's thesis](https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=20e9733e-6014-402d-afa9-20f3cc4a0568).

For implementations of the Remez algorithm see [QSPPACK](https://github.com/qsppack/qsppack).

[HPCG](https://github.com/hpcg-benchmark/hpcg/) seems like a good candidate for the CG code.
